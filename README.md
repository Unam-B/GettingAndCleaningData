# GettingAndCleaningData
This is my submission for the Coursera/Johns Hopkins University Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The data I worked with and cleaned can be found at the following link: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` is the code run to perform the analysis. 

The output of the 5th step is called `tidydata.txt`.
